# Draft Share
I made Draft Share a few years ago to give even nontechnical users (e.g., some folks in my online writing group) an easy, secure way to post their 
in-progress work to a webpage that automatically expires after a few hours. If they can share a URL, they can share their work.

This setup useful for getting feedback on something you're working on if you're not confident with your screensharing or Google Docs abilities.

Built with Node.js, MongoDB, and Bootstrap.
